## Factor Timing

Authors: Lucas Letul√©, Jonas Neller, Lorena Tassone

This project tries to replicate and extend the paper "Factor Timing" by Haddad et al. [2020].

All the used data can be found in the folder "Data", where the folder "FT_portfolio_sorts-monthly-05FEB2020" contains the data provided by Haddad et al. [2020].

The "Code" folder contains different code versions:
<ul>
  <li>main.py & Data_Cleaning.py belong to the replication of the paper</li>
  <li>The other codes have our extensions implemented. The used extension is defined in the name of the .py file, where each main_XX.py file has a corresponding Data_Cleaning_XX.py file.</li>
</ul>
