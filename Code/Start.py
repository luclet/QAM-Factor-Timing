#Notes:
#For each Anomaly strategy, we should have the relative valuation
#in the form of B/M ratio of unterlying stocks.
#bm is the difference of B/M between Port 10 and Port 1

###
#Proposed Code To Dos:
#1.
#-Get acustomed to data
#-divide data into first half / second half for OOS
#-calculate market beta of portfolios
#-market adjust data returns and bm ratios? (if not done already)
#-rescale market-adjusted returns and bm ratios, so the variance is equal across anomalies
#2.
#-Construct PCs of 50 Portfolios
#Table 1 (p. 18) would be the aggregate using the rescaling weights?
